Welcome to EZ-Map. Following this wiki should allow you to to map a room with a lidar and set up routes to execute, or drive the robot around using video streaming and remote control.

## Setup

Make sure you have all of these items assembled and ready to go before continuing.

### Magni robot

You'll need a robot to run the software, so if you are unfamilliar with the basics, start with the [Overview](noetic_overview_need_to_know) category in the navbar to get up to speed on how to use and [assemble](noetic_quickstart_unboxing) your robot.

If you intend to use EZ-Map with the optional **Tower & Shell**, make sure you install that as well using the [assembly instructions](noetic_quickstart_shell_tower).

### LiDAR sensor

EZ-Map requires a lidar for mapping, so one will need to be mounted before you can start.

- [UR-50 Long Range LiDAR](noetic_ur50_lidar)

- [UR-12 Short Range LiDAR](noetic_ur12_lidar)

While those two are supported out of the box, itâ€™s possible to run the suite with other lidars sensors, however the proper ROS driver is required. Please contact ubiquity support for help with that.

**NOTE:** Most of the documentation in this wiki (outside the EZ-Map section) is intended for people working with the a bare bones robot with a stock vanilla image, so while following teh assembly guides are fine, keep in mind that the manual software configurations listed should be ignored for EZ-Map. The setup may be slightly different and you should be able to make changes from a GUI and that will likely overwrite your manual file edits.

### Pi Camera

The camera used for remote viewing and fiducial marker detection that should already be included with the Magni, see [the setup instructions page](noetic_magnisilver_camera) on how to mount it. 

### EZ-Map software image

Usually delivered via email sendout. Once you have your img.xz file downloaded see the [guide on how to flash one it to a micro SD card](noetic_quick_start_microsd).

See the [changelogs page](ezmap_changelogs) to verify you have the latest version for your platform)


## Next up?

Once you have all that set up and the robot boots, continue to [the getting started page](noetic_ezmap_gettingstarted).
