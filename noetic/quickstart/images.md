## About the Pi Images

The Ubiquity Robotics Raspberry Pi images are based on Ubuntu. They are pre-installed with [ROS](https://ros.org/), perfect for building your Raspberry Pi robots. Based on the wonderful work of the (now defunct) Ubuntu Pi Flavor Makers.

The Pi Images are designed to work with the Raspberry Pi 3 (Model B and B+) and Raspberry Pi 4B (2GB and 4GB), we do not test on any other Pi's. They are known to not work at all on the Original Pi and the Pi Zero.

You can also support the image developers by donating :)
