For a standard Magni equipped with a Raspberry Pi 3 
you need a laptop or some way to open a terminal session 
to the Rpi controlling the robot. If the proper software 
is installed, and the Logitech controller dongle is 
installed on the Rpi, here are the commands needed to 
start the controller. After powering up the robot (Rpi 
power light is on and red). Assuming the robot is 
networked locally, or if you are using the default IP 
address (see connecting to your robot for the first 
time.)

On the laptop open up a terminal window with ctrl-alt-t

See if the robot is there:
{% highlight sh %}
ping robotname.local
{% endhighlight %}

the robot responds by giving you its IP number.

If your Robot is equiped with a Raspberry Pi 3 Ubiquity image, the Joystick and Fiducial follow programs should already be running.

you can test this by using the Joystick and seeing if the robot responds to commands. For safety sake, put the robot up on blocks first.(SAFETY TIP).

Then use the following command to login to the robot for example:

{% highlight sh %}
ssh ubuntu@10.0.0.117
{% endhighlight  %}

You may get asked to authorize your key, say yes.

You next should be prompted for your password, type it in and you’ll be logged in

upon success:

To see if the joystick is running, type:

rostopic list

If you see /joy  you are good to go!

If you don't see any topics you need to launch the logitech on the robot:

{% highlight sh %}
roslaunch magni_bringup base.launch >/dev/null 2>&1 & 
(the /dev/null 2 >&2 & puts into background and stops output to screen)


roslaunch magni_teleop logitech.launch >/dev/null 2>&1 &
{% endhighlight %}



The folowing command

{% highlight sh %}
rostopic list
{% endhighlight %}

/cmd_vel
/diagnostics
/joint_states
/joy
/left_error
/motor_node/parameter_descriptions
/motor_node/parameter_updates
/right_error
/rosout
/rosout_agg
/tf
/tf_static
/ubiquity_velocity_controller/cmd_vel
/ubiquity_velocity_controller/odom

Shows everything is running you know can use the controller to drive the robot.

If we were using keyboard teleop our keys would be arranged like this:


u i o

j k l

m , .


u circle left

i straight ahead

o circle right

j rotate counter clockwise

k all stop

l rotate clockwise

m circle backwards left

, straight back

. circle backwards left
