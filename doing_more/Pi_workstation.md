The default Ubiquity Robotics SD card image contains the Lubuntu desktop and can be run just like 
any desktop computer, even when attached to a robot. (It might be a a bit awkward though!)  If you attach an HDMI monitor and
keyboard/mouse combination via the USB port, the Lubuntu Destopu will open up.  A desktop tour ofLubuntu is available 
[Lubuntu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvrlGmTmmbg).
